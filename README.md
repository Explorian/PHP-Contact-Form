PHP Contact Form
================

A contact form made with PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript.

The front-end is built using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap "Twitter Bootstrap") and is therefore responsive. It can however be adapted to be used on any website.

Instructions

Follow these instructions to get the form working:

1. Clone repo!
2. Go to http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha and press 'Sign up Now', enter a domain name and press 'Create Key'.
3. In the contact.php file, go to line 104 and add your public key in between the quotes.
4. In the mail.php file, go to line 8 and add your private key in between the quotes.
5. In the mail.php file again, go to line 46 and add the email address you want the emails sent to.
6. Upload all files to a server with the PHP mail() extension installed to use.
